    My marketing Journey
  </h1>


  <div class="wavy-line"></div>
  <p class="paragraph-experience">
    My marketing journey began back in 2010, when I started a Bachelor’s degree in Advertising and Social Communication
    at
    Diego Portales University in Chile — one of the country’s top-ranked universities in advertising.
    After graduating in 2014, I dove straight into the marketing world, gaining hands-on experience across the tourism
    industry and later at a boutique marketing agency, where I managed up to six brands at once. This fast-paced
    environment
    sharpened my skills in:

    My Work in Australia
  </h2>

  <p class="paragraph-experience">

    Today, I work at Satellite Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation that supports young people navigating mental
    health
    challenges. My role includes:
    Creating engaging content for social media
    Updating landing pages and managing our website
    Running email campaigns
    Optimising internal workflows and marketing strategy
    In addition to my role at Satellite, I’ve worked with several other Australian organisations, including:
    Mister Magnets – promotional marketing
    IGS – product marketing and design
    BCTA – marketing support for the construction training sector

    My Passion Project
  </h2>
  <h3 class="sub-subtitle-experience">
    Casa Peak Grampians
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph-experience">

    Outside of my 9–5, I manage Casa Peak Grampians, a cozy Airbnb nestled in the heart of Halls Gap. I built the
    website
    myself using WordPress, and integrated it with tools like Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager to boost
    visibility
    and track performance. I handle:
    SEO and content strategy
    Guest communication
    Booking management
    Coordination with cleaners and support staff
    This project blends my love of travel, design, and data-driven marketing — and it’s been incredibly rewarding to see
    it
    grow.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph-experience">

    I have hands-on experience with SEO best practices focused on content optimisation. I’ve completed an SEO course and
    use
    tools like Yoast and Rank Math to improve structure, meta data, headlines, and keyword targeting — helping content
    become more discoverable and user-friendly. While I’m not a technical SEO specialist, I understand how to
    collaborate
    with developers or use guidance to ensure accessibility and performance are also considered.
